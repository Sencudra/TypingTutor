# TypingTutor

A simple Type Tutor written after a half year studing C and C++ in university. The project represents itself a couple of alghoritms working with user input data, text's for exercises and qml interface.

Achievements:
1) Mode with infinite text
2) Working user interface (highlighting keys). Two two keyboard layouts for Russian and Engilsh(Auto switching)
3) Quick sort for stat

Other stuff, like time measurement, text selector, text loader from file, stat writer and table. Simple but especially valuable features, which make the whole system quite hard to realise.  Not ideal neither in realisation neither in code style.
